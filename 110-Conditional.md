# Conditional Checkpoint

Create a function that takes a birth year (number) as an argument. Your function should return the name of the generation someone born in that year would belong to.

| Generation Name | Birth Years |
| --- | --- |
| Old Timer | 1963 and earlier |
| Baby Boomer | 1946 to 1964 |
| Gen X | 1965 to 1985 |
| Millennial | 1986 to 1996 |
| Gen Z | 1997 to now |

## Examples:

### Example 1

```js
myGeneration(1973);
```

should return 

```js
"Gen X"
```

### Example 3

```js
myGeneration(1922);
```

should return


```js

```

### Example 2
